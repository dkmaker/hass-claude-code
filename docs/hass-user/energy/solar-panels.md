Gain insight into your energy production by integrating your solar panels into Home Assistant.

If you also set up [the Solar Forecast integration](/integrations/forecast_solar), you will be able to see expected solar production and automate based on planned production.

## Hardware

Home Assistant will need to know the amount of energy that is being produced. This can be done in various ways.

### Using a CT clamp sensor

{% include energy/ct_clamp.md %}

### Connecting to your inverter

Some solar inverters have APIs that can be read by Home Assistant.
