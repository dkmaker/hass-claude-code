While you can configure most of Home Assistant from the user interface, for some integrations, you need to edit the `configuration.yaml` file.

This file contains {% term integrations %} to be loaded along with their configurations. Throughout the documentation, you will find snippets that you can add to your configuration file to enable specific functionality.

Example of a configuration.yaml file, accessed using the File editor app on a Home Assistant Operating System installation.

## Editing `configuration.yaml`

How you edit your `configuration.yaml` file depends on your editor preferences and the [installation type](/installation/#about-installation-types) you used to set up Home Assistant. Follow these steps:

1. [Set up file access](#to-set-up-access-to-the-files-and-prepare-an-editor).
2. [Locate the config directory](#to-find-the-configuration-directory).
3. [Edit your `configuration.yaml` file](#to-edit-the-configuration-file).
4. Save your changes and [reload the configuration](#reloading-the-configuration-to-apply-changes) to apply the changes.

### To set up access to the files and prepare an editor

Before you can edit a file, you need to know how to access files in Home Assistant and setup an editor.
File access depends on your [installation type](/installation/#about-installation-types). If you use {% term "Home Assistant Operating System" %}, you can use editor apps, for example. If you use {% term "Home Assistant Container" %}, apps are not available.

To set up file access on the Home Assistant Operating System, follow these steps:

- If you are unsure which option to choose, install the [file editor app](/common-tasks/os/#installing-and-using-the-file-editor-app).
  - Alternatively, use the [Studio Code Server app](/common-tasks/os/#installing-and-using-the-visual-studio-code-vsc-app). This editor offers live syntax checking and auto-fill of various Home Assistant entities. But it looks more complex than the file editor.
  - If you prefer to use a file editor on your computer, use the [Samba app](/common-tasks/os/#installing-and-using-the-samba-app).

### To find the configuration directory

1. To look up the path to your configuration directory, go to {% my system_health title="**Settings** > **System** > **Repairs**" %}.
   - Select the three dots menu and select **System information**.

2. Find out the location of the **Configuration directory**.

    ![Screenshot showing the top of the system information panel](/images/screenshots/system_information.png)
   - Unless you changed the file structure, the default is as follows:     - 
     - {% term "Home Assistant Operating System" %}: the `configuration.yaml` is in the `/config` folder of the installation.
     - {% term "Home Assistant Container" %}: the `configuration.yaml` is in the config folder that you mounted in your container.

### To edit the configuration file

Once you have located the config folder, you can edit your `configuration.yaml` file. How you edit the file depends on the editor you set up in step 1:

- **If you are using the File editor app**: Open the app, navigate to the `/config` folder in the file browser on the left, and select the `configuration.yaml` file to open it in the editor.
- **If you are using the Studio Code Server app**: Open the app, use the file explorer on the left to navigate to the `configuration.yaml` file, and select it to open in the editor.
- **If you are using Samba to access files**: Navigate to the shared folder on your computer, locate the `configuration.yaml` file, and open it with your favorite text editor like [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

{% note %}

If you have watched any videos about setting up Home Assistant using `configuration.yaml` (particularly ones that are old), you might notice your default configuration file is much smaller than what the videos show. Don't be concerned, you haven't done anything wrong. Many items in the default configuration files shown in those old videos are now included in the `default_config:` line that you see in your configuration file. Refer to the [default config integration](/integrations/default_config/) for more information on what's included in that line.

{% endnote %}

## Validating the configuration

After changing configuration or automation files, you can check if the configuration is valid. A configuration check is also applied automatically when you reload the configuration or when you restart Home Assistant.

The method for running a configuration check depends on your [installation type](/installation/#about-installation-types). Check the common tasks for your installation type:

- [Configuration check on Operating System](/common-tasks/os/#configuration-check)
- [Configuration check on Container](/common-tasks/container/#configuration-check)

## Reloading the configuration to apply changes

For configuration changes to become effective, the configuration must be reloaded. Most integrations in Home Assistant (that do not interact with {% term devices %} or {% term services %}) can reload changes made to their configuration in `configuration.yaml` without needing to restart Home Assistant.

1. Under **Settings**, select the three dots menu (top right) {% icon "mdi:dots-vertical" %}, select **Restart Home Assistant** > **Quick reload**.

   ![Settings, three dot menu, restart Home Assistant](/images/docs/configuration/settings_restart_ha.png)

2. If you find that your changes were not applied, you need to restart.
   - Select **Restart Home Assistant**.
   - Note: This interrupts automations and scripts.

## Troubleshooting the configuration

If you run into trouble while configuring Home Assistant, refer to the [configuration troubleshooting page](/docs/configuration/troubleshooting/).
