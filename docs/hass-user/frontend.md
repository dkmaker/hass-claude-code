The Home Assistant [frontend integration](/integrations/frontend/) provides the graphical user interface that allows you to browse and control the state of your house, manage automations, and configure integrations.

  

Home Assistant comes with [built-in dashboards](/dashboards/dashboards/#home-assistant-built-in-dashboards). But you can also create and customize your own dashboards.

## Creating and styling your own dashboards

## User- or browser-dependent settings, general settings

### User- or browser-dependent settings

Some of the frontend settings depend on the user. Other settings can be set by client. This allows you, for example, to have different languages per user and different device-specific settings.

To change these settings, in the bottom left, select your username to open your {% my profile title="**User profile**" %}.

- To change general settings such as language, number, time format, and theme, go to the **User settings**.
- To change browser-dependent settings such as sidebar behavior, use the **Browser settings**.

### Themes

Themes are set per user. In the {% my profile title="**User profile**" %}, you can define theme settings, such as whether you want a light or dark theme. More detailed theme settings require YAML configuration. Refer to the documentation of the [frontend integration](/integrations/frontend/).

### General settings

Some of the settings, such as location and currency, were defined during the onboarding process. They can be changed under {% my general title="**Settings** > **System** > **General**" %}. Refer to the documentation on [setup basic information](/docs/configuration/basic/).
